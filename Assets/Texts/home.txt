# EEG Classification Model

### Project Overview

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of EEG-based classification models. The project utilizes the **EEG-Based BCI Four-Class Wheelchair Application** dataset from Kaggle, which contains **EEG recordings** from $9$ subjects performing four different mental tasks associated with  movement 
* Left Hand
* Right Hand
* Foot 
* Tongue

By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, specifically **ATC-NET** models, we aimed to achieve high classification accuracy for each individual subject. 

### Research Gap and Project Significance
While existing BCI-based wheelchair control systems have demonstrated promising results, there are still challenges to overcome:

* **Individual Variability** : EEG signals exhibit significant variation between individuals, making it difficult to create a "one-size-fits-all" model. This project addresses this issue by training separate ATC-NET models for each subject, tailoring the classification process to their unique brainwave patterns.

* **Classification Accuracy** : Achieving high and reliable classification accuracy is crucial for practical BCI applications. Our project explores the capabilities of ATC-NETs, a deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in handling complex EEG data, to optimize classification performance.

* **Real-time Implementation** : Transitioning from offline analysis to real-time control is a significant challenge. This project lays the groundwork for future real-time implementation by establishing a robust foundation for accurate EEG classification.

By addressing these research gaps, this project contributes to the advancement of BCI technology, offering the potential to enhance the quality of life for individuals with mobility limitations.

### Further research directions could explore:

* **Hybrid BCIs** : Combining EEG with other biosignals or control methods for more robust and flexible control.
* **Adaptive models** : Developing models that continuously adapt to changes in user's EEG patterns over time.
* **Miniaturization and wearability** : Investigating ways to make the BCI system more compact and user-friendly for daily life applications.
